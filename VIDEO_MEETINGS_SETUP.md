## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the entire content of `video-meetings-migration.sql`
4. Click "Run"

This creates all necessary tables and security policies.

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env.local` has:

```bash
# Supabase (you already have these)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

# Stripe (you already have these)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret
```

### Step 3: Add Navigation Link

Add this to your navigation menu in `EnterpriseLandingPage.tsx` or wherever you want:

```tsx
<a
  href="/video-meetings"
  className="text-white hover:text-blue-300 transition-all"
>
  Video Meetings
  <span className="ml-2 px-2 py-0.5 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 text-white text-xs rounded-full font-bold">
    $9.99
  </span>
</a>
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Server Costs (Jitsi Self-Hosted)

### Option 2: Self-Host Jitsi (Recommended for Scale)

When you hit 50+ active users, self-host for better branding and unlimited scale:

**DigitalOcean Droplet**:
- Small (10-50 users): $24/month (4GB RAM)
- Medium (50-200 users): $48/month (8GB RAM)
- Large (200-1000 users): $120/month (16GB RAM)

**Setup Time**: ~2 hours with their guide

}
```

### 2. Add Custom Domain

When you self-host Jitsi, change:

```tsx
const domain = 'meet.yourcompany.com'; // instead of 'meet.jit.si'
```

### 3. Adjust Participant Limit

In the database migration, change:

```sql
max_participants INTEGER DEFAULT 100,  -- Change to 50, 200, etc.
```

### 4. Add Meeting Password

In the Jitsi config:

```tsx
configOverwrite: {

## üö® Important Notes

### Current Limitations
1. Using Jitsi's free server (meet.jit.si)
   - Great for testing and early users
   - Limited to ~50 concurrent users
   - Jitsi branding visible

2. No recording storage yet
   - Recordings download to user's device
   - You could add Supabase storage later

3. No calendar integration yet
   - Can add Google Calendar sync
   - Can add Outlook integration

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Self-host Jitsi for full control
- [ ] Add calendar integration
- [ ] Cloud recording storage
- [ ] Meeting transcriptions
- [ ] AI meeting summaries
- [ ] Breakout rooms
- [ ] Polls & Q&A
- [ ] Whiteboard collaboration

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Meeting won't load"
- Check user is subscribed in database
- Check browser allows camera/mic access
- Check Jitsi script loaded (check browser console)

### "Can't create meeting"
- Verify database migration ran successfully
- Check RLS policies are active
- Verify user has active subscription

### "Subscription check failing"
- Ensure `subscriptions` table exists
- Check `status` column = 'active'
- Verify `user_id` matches auth.uid()

## üí° Next Steps

1. **Run the database migration** (video-meetings-migration.sql)
2. **Test the flow**:
   - Create account ‚Üí Subscribe ‚Üí Create meeting
3. **Add navigation link** to your main menu
4. **Launch to first 10 beta users** (free trial?)
5. **Get feedback and iterate**
6. **Scale up** when you hit 50+ concurrent users
