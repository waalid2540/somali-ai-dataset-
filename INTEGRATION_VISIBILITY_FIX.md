I've enhanced the integration visibility so you'll immediately see them when you visit your deployed site:

### What I Added:

1. **ðŸ”¥ Prominent Integration Showcase** - Big colorful banner on main dashboard
2. **âš¡ "NEW" Badge** - Eye-catching notification on integration tab  
3. **ðŸŽ¯ Direct Button** - "View Integrations â†’" button in showcase
4. **ðŸ’« Better Tab Styling** - More prominent, colorful tabs
5. **ðŸš€ Auto-Switch Feature** - Button automatically switches to integration tab

## What You'll See Now âœ…

### On Main Dashboard:
- **Large emerald-blue banner** saying "ðŸš€ New: Business Automation Integrations"
- **Clear description**: "Connect your AI tools to Gmail, Stripe, Facebook, LinkedIn, HubSpot, and more!"
- **Key benefits**: "11 Integrations Available â€¢ Zero Setup Costs â€¢ Customer API Keys"
- **Big "View Integrations â†’" button** that takes you directly to integrations

### At Top Navigation:
- **"âš¡ Business Integrations" tab** with animated "NEW" badge
- **Enhanced styling** - more prominent and colorful
- **"ðŸ“Š ROI Analytics" tab** - shows cost savings

## Push Commands

Copy and paste these:

```bash
cd /Users/yussufabdi/english-checkpoint-truck-driver/somali-ai-dataset-clean
```

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "ðŸš€ Make integrations highly visible - Prominent showcase & navigation

âœ… Add prominent integration showcase banner on main dashboard
âœ… Add 'NEW' badge and better styling for integration tab
