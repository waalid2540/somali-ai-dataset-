  content: blogResult.content,
  platforms: ['facebook', 'linkedin', 'twitter']
});
```

### Email Marketing Automation
```typescript
// Example: AI-generated email sent through customer's Gmail
const emailResult = await integrationEngine.sendEmail(credentials, {
  to: customerList,
  subject: aiGeneratedSubject,
  htmlContent: aiGeneratedEmail
});
```

### Lead Capture & CRM Integration
```typescript
// Example: Leads automatically sent to HubSpot
const leadResult = await integrationEngine.captureLead(credentials, {
  name: leadData.name,
  email: leadData.email,
  source: 'AI Tools Platform'
});
```
